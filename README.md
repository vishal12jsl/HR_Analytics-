## Insights
- we got the work pattern of employees
- we saw the trend that Work from home employee % increases,that is more number of employees prefered doing work form home
- we got the leave pattern so if there is any construction to undertake we can get it done on those days 
- if number of employees increases and if for a period of time company lacks space so we can easily rotate employees working days
